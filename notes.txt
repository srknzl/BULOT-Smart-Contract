xN = rN1 ^ rN2 ^ rN3 ^ ... ^rN(number of revealers)

function for calculating ith winners and also prizes

Write as a view function
getWinner(i)

i1 = hash(xN) mod number of revealers
i2 = hash(hash(xN)) mod number of revealers

...


write for loop with logarithmic size at most. 

Pi = ⌊M /2i⌋ + (⌊M /2i− 1⌋ mod 2) i = 1,...,⌈log2(M)⌉
